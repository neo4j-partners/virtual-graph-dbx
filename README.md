# Virtual Graph Demo

This project demonstrates the Neo4j Virtual Graph, which enables zero-copy querying of
Databricks lakehouses with Cypher. The Virtual Graph compiles Cypher into SQL and pushes
most of the work down to the backing Databricks SQL warehouse; graph-specific operations
are handled by Neo4j's graph compute layer, and how much runs where depends on the query.
The project walks through setting up the Finance Genie sample lakehouse on Databricks,
creating a Virtual Graph over it in Aura, and querying that graph. It also documents best
practices, how to use GDS Sessions, and the current limitations of the Virtual Graph.

Finance Genie is a synthetic dataset of bank accounts, merchants, and the transfers
between them. Virtual Graph is in preview, and the official docs advise against using
sensitive or production data with it; this demo uses only that synthetic dataset.

This [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) Python demo runs Cypher against the Finance Genie
Virtual Graph. It includes the following demo sets:

| Demo | What it is | Everything works? |
|---|---|---|
| `basic` | warm-up exploration and visualization queries | yes |
| `fraud` | the fast fraud-signal queries from `finding-fraud.md` | yes |
| `fast-gds` | the working GDS Session + PageRank path | yes, on a small window |
| `slow-gds` | the GDS forms that do not work, kept as a demonstration | no, by design |
| `gds-probe` | sweep projections that add node / relationship properties, to isolate which property types the projection rejects | mixed, by design |

The queries build up gradually, from simple counts, through fraud-signal queries, to
graph algorithms like PageRank, so you can see both what runs well and where the Virtual
Graph reaches its current limits.

Getting it running is three steps: create the Silver tables on Databricks, build the
Virtual Graph over them in Aura, then run the demos.

## Quick start

Prerequisites:

- `uv` installed.
- A Databricks workspace with permission to create a schema, volume, and tables, used
  once by the lakehouse setup notebook (Step 1).
- A project `.env` (copy `.env.sample`) with the Aura connection:

  ```
  NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://<instance>.graph-engine.neo4j.io
  NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
  NEO4J_PASSWORD=<password>
  ```

  At demo runtime only the `NEO4J_*` values are read.

  ```bash
  cp .env.sample .env   # then fill in the NEO4J_* values
  ```

## Step 1: Create the Silver tables

The Virtual Graph reads the Finance Genie Silver tables, so they must exist before you
build it. Run [`notebooks/01_setup_lakehouse.ipynb`](notebooks/01_setup_lakehouse.ipynb)
in your Databricks workspace. It downloads the Finance Genie dataset from the public
[graph-on-databricks](https://github.com/neo4j-partners/graph-on-databricks) repo, stages
the CSVs into a Unity Catalog Volume, and builds the five base tables (`accounts`,
`merchants`, `transactions`, `account_links`, `account_labels`) with their column
comments and foreign keys. Set the catalog / schema / volume in the notebook's
configuration cell; the defaults match the Finance Genie pipeline.

## Step 2: Build the Virtual Graph

Build a Virtual Graph over the Finance Genie Silver tables with node labels `:Account`
and `:Merchant` (and the `TRANSACTED_WITH` and `TRANSFERRED_TO` relationships between
them), set up as described in [virtual-graph.md](virtual-graph.md). That walkthrough
covers connecting Databricks as a data source in Aura, defining the schema, and
confirming the graph reads from the warehouse.

## Step 3: Run the demos

Run any demo from the project root (`uv run` installs the project and its dependencies
on first use):

```bash
uv run vg-demo                          # fraud demo (default): the 7 fast queries
uv run vg-demo --all                    # also attempt the slow / unsupported queries
uv run vg-demo --demo basic             # exploration / visualization queries
uv run vg-demo --demo fast-gds --since-hours 2   # working PageRank path (thin window)
uv run vg-demo --demo slow-gds          # demonstrate the GDS forms that fail
uv run vg-demo --demo gds-probe --since-hours 2   # sweep property projections (thin window)
```

Useful flags: `--rows N` caps printed rows per query, `--timeout S` sets the per-query
server timeout (default 120s), `--query N` / `--only N M` pick specific fraud queries.

## What the demos provide

### `basic` demo

Counts, breakdowns, and small anchored traversals that show the value of the
relationships without any fraud logic. All run. The `graph` queries return nodes and
relationships, so the CLI prints only a row count and timing; paste them into the Aura
Workspace Query tab to see the picture. The demo prints the anchor account and merchant
IDs it picked.

| # | What it does | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Count of accounts | table |
| 2 | Count of merchants | table |
| 3 | Accounts grouped by type | table |
| 4 | Accounts grouped by region | table |
| 5 | Merchants grouped by category | table |
| 6 | Top 10 merchants by distinct customers | table |
| 7 | Ego network: one account and the merchants it shops at | graph |
| 8 | Ego network: one account and its transfer partners | graph |
| 9 | Merchant star: one merchant and the accounts that use it | graph |
| 10 | Two hops: accounts linked through a shared merchant | graph |
| 11 | Two hops: a transfer chain (who your counterparty pays) | graph |

### `fraud` demo

The seven fast queries (1-7) are the pushdown-friendly forms from
[`finding-fraud.md`](finding-fraud.md). They group by scalar IDs,
reshape a `count(DISTINCT)` into pair-grouping plus a client-side rollup for the fan-in
and fan-out queries, and split a cross product into two merged halves for the courier
query. The server aggregates and orders; the threshold filters and top-N run in Python;
recent windows are passed as a precomputed `$since` parameter. Each returns in a few
seconds.

| # | What it does | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Structuring: accounts with many transfers sized just under $10,000 | works |
| 2 | Busy brand-new accounts: recently opened accounts already moving large volume | works |
| 3 | Round trips: account pairs paying each other both ways (wash activity) | works |
| 4 | Velocity ratio: accounts moving far more money than they hold | works |
| 5 | Collection accounts (fan-in): many distinct senders into one account | works |
| 6 | Spray accounts (fan-out): one account paying many distinct recipients | works |
| 7 | Courier accounts: heavy peer-to-peer transfers, little merchant spend | works |

The slow tier (8-11) has no fast equivalent and is skipped unless you pass `--all`. It
is kept to demonstrate what does not work. With `--all` these run behind a printed
warning, bounded by `--timeout`, and any error is caught and printed so the run
continues.

| # | What it does | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 8 | Pass-through mule (local betweenness proxy) | slow: unbounded two-hop join, usually times out |
| 9 | Shared-merchant burst (coordinated ring) | slow: `collect(DISTINCT)` over a node group, hit the 120s timeout |
| 10 | Rapid-turnover per account | slow: unbounded two-hop join, usually times out |
| 11 | Layering cycles | unsupported: variable-length path `{2,4}` fails with `42NG0` |

### `fast-gds` demo

GDS is not an in-database plugin on the Virtual Graph. The path that works in practice is
a **GDS Session**: the Cypher-projection form of `gds.graph.project(...)` with a `{ memory }`
config provisions an ephemeral session, then PageRank streams against the named
in-memory graph. The demo runs its statements one at a time: size the window, drop any
stale projection, project (this provisions the session), stream PageRank, drop.

The "window" is a time-range filter on the transfer rows: `--since-hours` / `--since-days`
keep only transfers from the most recent N hours or days of the data, and that row count
is the edge count projected into the graph. "Size the window" counts those rows without
provisioning a session.

What it looks like on a thin window (the most recent 2 hours of transfers):

```
--- size window (count edges, last 2.0h)        OK 0.6s, 298 edges
--- project ... (provisions the session)        OK 90.9s, 556 nodes / 298 rels
--- PageRank stream (top 10)                     OK 3.9s, 10 rows
--- drop projection                              OK 1.0s
```

Almost all the time is session cold-start, not the query or the algorithm. Streamed
`nodeId`s are GDS-internal IDs, not `account_id`s; resolving them back is not reliable on
the Virtual Graph yet, so the demo streams the raw ID and score.

**Keep the window small.** `--count-only` counts the rows in a window for free. A thin
window (`--since-hours 2`, the most recent 2 hours of transfers, a few hundred edges)
provisions and completes. The default 7-day window is about 23,000 edges, which trips the
read timeout during provisioning (see the `slow-gds` demo below). Use `--since-hours` / `--since-days` to scope it, `--limit` to change the top-N,
`--memory` to size the session, and `--keep` to leave the projection in place for reuse.

### `slow-gds` demo

Demonstrates the two GDS failure modes on the Virtual Graph, both caught and printed:

| Statement | What happens |
|---|---|
| Classic `CALL gds.graph.project('g', 'Account', 'TRANSFERRED_TO')` | rejected fast with `42NG0` (the label/type form is not supported) |
| Full-graph Cypher projection (every transfer) | provisions a session whose long, silent provisioning trips the 60s Bolt read timeout (observed at ~240s) or is reset by the server |

`--read-timeout 0` lets the full projection survive past 60s to show the later server
reset. The full projection cannot be cancelled once started and can saturate the pool,
so run this on a clean instance.

### `gds-probe` demo

The fast-gds projection carries only labels and the relationship type; it never projects
`amount` or `transfer_timestamp` as graph properties. This demo isolates what happens when
you add properties: a GDS in-memory graph only accepts **numeric** property types, so it
sweeps a series of projections on a thin window where the timeout stays out of the
picture, adding one node or relationship property at a time, and reports which ones project
and which the server rejects. It first introspects the live schema and prints each property's type, then
runs:

| Scenario | Projection adds | Result |
|---|---|---|
| A_control | labels + `relationshipType` only | projects |
| B_rel_amount | `relationshipProperties { amount }` (float) + weighted PageRank | projects, weight usable |
| C_rel_timestamp | `relationshipProperties { transfer_timestamp }` (`DateTime`) | rejected fast |
| D_rel_both | `amount` + `transfer_timestamp` | rejected on the temporal one |
| E_node_numeric | a numeric node property on both endpoints | projects |
| F_node_nonnumeric | a string node property on both endpoints | rejected fast |

Each rejection comes back in under a second, before the session provisions, as
`IllegalArgumentException: The property ... contained a value of type DateTime/String,
which is not supported`. This is standard GDS typing, not a Virtual Graph defect: project
only numeric columns, and cast or drop temporal and string ones. See the modeling note in
[`gds-guide.md`](gds-guide.md). Use `--count-only` to introspect the schema without
provisioning, and `--since-hours` / `--since-days` to size the window.

### Support scripts

These standalone scripts probe and stress the Virtual Graph; they share the connection
helper in `src/connection.py` (reads the project `.env`, or `PROBE_ENV` if set):

- `vg-probe` (`src/probe.py`): run a single ad-hoc Cypher statement and time it
  (`uv run vg-probe "<cypher>"`).
- `vg-heavy` (`src/heavy_run.py`): run the slow fraud queries sequentially with a
  per-query cap and a pool health check between each.
- `vg-viz` (`src/viz_check.py`): find real flagged accounts and confirm each anchored
  visualization renders small and fast.
