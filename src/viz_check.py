"""Verify the anchored fraud-visualization queries against the Virtual Graph.

For each laundering shape (collection account, spray account, round-trip pair) this
finds a real flagged account, then runs the matching anchored ego-network query and
reports how many rows come back, confirming each visualization renders small and fast.

Reads the project ``.env`` at the repository root by default; set ``PROBE_ENV`` to
point at another dotenv.
