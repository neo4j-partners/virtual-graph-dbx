"""Single-query probe for the Virtual Graph.

Runs one Cypher statement, measures wall-clock time, prints the result, and never
abandons the query (no thread cap, no client timeout). Pass the Cypher as argv[1].

    uv run vg-probe "RETURN 1 AS ok"

Reads the project ``.env`` at the repository root by default; set ``PROBE_ENV`` to
point at another dotenv.
